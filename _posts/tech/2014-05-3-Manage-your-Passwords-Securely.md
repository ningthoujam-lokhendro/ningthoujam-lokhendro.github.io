Ever wonder how many sites has you signed up and forgot those credentials to log-in. USERNAME and PASSWORD management can become quite cumbersome. Where do you store those Information so that you can have a peace of mind. Each of us might use certain ways to store according to their needs. I used Excel sheet before to store all my credential and their details. But there are certain infeasible in using them.

## Using Excel Sheet
`Work and Office:` Multiple copies and trouble syncing them.<br/>
`Transfer:` During transfer might be USB or email, there is always doubt of someone laying hand onto.<br/>
`Travel:` It becomes more insecure if you are using public computers.

## Manage Password
All this are ease up if you use Online Password Management. You need to remember a single sign-in credentials and have peace of mind of remembering all other. There are many services available, but among them the most popular are [LassPass][LassPass] and [PassPack][PassPack]. Each has its own pro and cons. I have used both and transferring the data between them is quite easy. I prefer passpack as its feature are more secure and easy to use.

### 1. Two Shield Security
Log-in to passpack need two level â€“ `Master Password and a Packing Key`.

One of my original attractions to Passpack was the security. All data is encrypted locally via your own encryption key which you need to enter to gain access to your account. That means to gain entry you need the username, password and packing key (essentially a 2nd password).

### 2. Interface
Excel style data entry. You can store extra details more then the credential.

### 3. No of Entry
You need to pay if you want to store more than 100. But usual web-user would not reach that much.

### 4. Sharing
Collaboration becomes easy with your friends, family and colleague. If you want to share you password, you don't need to send as clear-text in IM or email but using the sharing feature it has within.

If you are sharing certain account with your colleague or friend or project mate, sharing becomes easy. Even if you update it, they would see the most recent one. If you have to share with IM/Email, you have to sent over again.

### 5. 1-Click Log-in
This feature is auto-login where if you desire on the feature can log-in with a single click.

### 6. Organize
Passpack helps organised your credentials by letting you tag, sort, search and manage multiple logins per site.

### 7. Host Proof
Passpack does not store any un-encrypted data at their server which means that even if their server is compromise your password would be saved.

### 8. Choose Security Level:
You can choose which entry is to store more securely. There are two option available: Double and Triple.

### 9. Availability
It is always available online and forget about having to carry or remember the data. Most importantly, their server is up almost all time. Check their server status here : [PINGDOM][PINGDOM]

### 10. Copies
You can have multiple ways to your data:

1. `Desktop :` You need adobe air and instruction are at https://www.passpack.com/passpack-desktop/
2. `Offline:` You can carry passpack offline securely by making it portable in USB stick with Google Gear technology. Instruction at [passpack-offline-on-usb-with-google-gears][passpack-offline-on-usb-with-google-gears].
3. `Export:` All packpack data that you have can be exported and store locally or over the cloud. Exporting option is available in Comma Separated Value(CSV), Tab Separated Value and Printable HTML format.

Now that you know these benefit go ahead and sign-up at Passpack and forgot all other passwords.

## BACKUP Personally
We should also be paranoid for Internet Today so a backup and storing them securely. Passpack data can be exported in CSV, TSV or HTML. These files will be in clear text and if anyone get hand on it all you password are compromise. So the best way is to Encrypt it and store it securely at cloud service like [skydrive][skydrive], [dropbox][dropbox] or [google drive][google drive].

To encrypt the file you can use a `PGP(Preety Good Privacy)`. A windows version of an implemented type is [GPG4WIN][GPG4WIN] and its free as it is under GNU license.
